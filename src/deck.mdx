# Mission of the New Techology Infrastructure

---

A fresh look into the existing tech stack.

Re-evaluate technical choices for web app development.

---

# Goals

- Productivity

- Community

- Maturity

---

Imagine yourself as a **new hire**

How **easy** is it to adopt the tech stack?

How **fast** is it to develop a new feature?

How **sustainable** is it to maintain the tech stack over time?

How **flexiable** is it to customize the tech stack?

---

These are the questions we should constantly ask ourselves when exploring a new tech stack.

---

# The core of existing tech stack -- Angular

---

## Angular -- a framework

... and a heavily opinionated one.

---

# Angular:
# RxJS and Observables

---

## Angular: RxJS

Angular HTTP client returns Observables.

RxJS is an implementation of Observables.

Observables are suitable for stream-like data.

```notes
- Angular’s HTTP client returns Observables instead of Promises, forcing you not only to learn another async library, but a completely different async paradigm.
- Observables offers little tangible improvements over Promises when used for Ajax requests.
- Many Rx.js methods are illustrated using streams like this. This is semantically suitable for data that are actually streams, but far too over-engineered for single value requests.
- The extreme power of RxJS entails its complexity to master.
- if you’re just using it in place of a single callback function is not very useful
- Backbone is every open and easy to do things outside the “intended” use; when in Angular doing things outside the intended patterns are much more difficult
- Moreover, even with all of the great features Rx gives us - making it framework core is not the best approach. https://gist.github.com/Igogrek/36d47f7547b679e7dab2bc595e36c0e9
- I think that people like me (who really like Rx) would've easily integrated it themselves if needed, instead of forcing it as default. This wasn't a problem for me, but a lot of people I know have a hard time understanding Observables, Subjects, etc. All of that on top of general Angular complexity seem to be very harsh on framework newcomers (most of those just cast HTTP resulted Observable to Promise).
- 104 operators vs. Promise's 6 methods
```

---

## ... but making it framework core is not the best approach

---

## Angular: RxJS

Require a paradigm shift to RFP (Reactive Functional Programming).

Over-complicate for most REST API calls.

---

RxJS' **104** operators vs. Promise's **7** methods

... A lot of people I know have a hard time understanding Observables, Subjects, etc. All of that on top of general Angular complexity seem to be **very harsh on framework newcomers**.

---

We literally rejcted interview candidates because they don't know Observable APIs. But RxJS is not as widely accepted in the JavaScript community as we thought.

---

## Angular: RxJS

[RxJS is great. So why have I moved on?](https://medium.com/@puppybits/rxjs-is-great-so-why-have-i-moved-on-534c513e7af3)

---

## Back to our Goals

Again, imagine yourself as a new hire.

**Productiviy**: Embrace simple and effective solutions.

**Community**: Use something widely supported in the community.

**Maturity**: Favor something battle-proven over a long period of time.

---

## How can we get there?

Replace Angular's HTTP client with Promise based client (e.g., Axios).

Use RxJS observables only where they are appropriate.

---

# Angular:
# HTML Template

---

Angular template has its own DSL syntax:

```html
<p>{{ name | slice:1:5 }}</p>
```

---

At first, you might think the DSL syntax is OK. But it can quickly get unwieldy.

---

for loop

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn">
    {{item.id}}
  </li>
</ul>
```

Special syntax just for a loop.

---

if-else

```html
<div *ngIf="someCondition; else falsyTemplate">
  <h1>Condition Passed!</h1>
</div>

<ng-template #falsyTemplate>
  <h1>Condition Failed!</h1>
</ng-template>
```

Again, special syntax just for if and else. Angular 4 even touts “else” with *ngIf as a new feature.

---

<Image src="assets/images/ng-if-else.png" size="contain" />

---

When developer's fluency in basic **if-else** statements is in question, what do you think how productive they will code?

---

## Angular: HTML Template

This DSL syntax resembles FreeMarker template.

Template-driven frameworks all invent their own DSLs which are not standard anywhere else.

```notes
The knowledge required to work with these DSLs cannot be borrowed from outside, and cannot be exported to the ourside world.
```

---

## How do we improve?

Re-use what JavaScript developers already know -- JavaScript.

No need for DSL to code basic statements.

---

For example, instead of having:
```html
<div *ngIf="someCondition; else falsyTemplate">
  <h1>Condition Passed!</h1>
</div>

<ng-template #falsyTemplate>
  <h1>Condition Failed!</h1>
</ng-template>
```

switch to JavaScript ternary operator
```jsx
<div>
  {someCondition ? <h1>Condition Passed!</h1> : <h1>Condition Failed!</h1>}
</div>
```

---

Every software developer knows ternary operators:

`(condition? A: B)`

No ramp up time required to learn a special DSL.

---

More exmaple: a list component using Angular's *ngForOf

```js
@Component({
  ...
  template: `<ul>
    <li *ngFor="let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn">
      {{item.id}}
    </li>
  </ul>`,
})
export class App {
  ...
  trackByFn(index, item) {
    return index;
  }
}
```

---

Same component in React with JavaScript's `map` function

```jsx
function App({items}) {
  return <ul>
    {items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item.id}</li>)}
  </ul>
};
```

---

Even more exmaple:

Angular's slice filter. Again, special DSL:
```html
<p>{{ name | slice:1:5 }}</p>
```

React. Array's built-in `slice` function:
```jsx
<p>{name.slice(1,5)}</p>
```

---

| Angular       | Plain JavaScript                       |
| ------------- |:--------------------------------------:|
| *ngForOf      | Array.map                              |
| *ngIf         | if-else statement or ternary operator  |
| filter pipe   | plain function                         |

Angular invented a DSL syntax because the framework is template driven.

The DSL deviates away from common JS knowledge.

All these smalls could potentially add up to the loss of daily productivity.

---

## Recap: how do we improve?

Once more, imagine yourself as a new hire.

**Productivity**: Let JavaScript deal with logics and code path. Do what it is best at.

**Maturity/Productivity**: Use standard JavaScript APIs instead of non-standard DSLs.

---

# Angular:
# Tool Chain

---

## Angular: Ng CLI

Ng CLI is Angular's recommended building tools.

Widely adopted for its out-of-box functionalities.

---

... however, it is **over-abstracted** and **inflexible**.

---

## Angular CLI and Webpack

Webpack is the centerpiece of the building process.

It governs code splitting, minimization, optimization, post processing, transformation, bundling, etc.

It is very important for developers to have **full control of webpack configuration**.

---

However, in Angualr webpack configuration is generated and encapsulated.

...where in React and Vue, developers have **direct access** to webpack configuration.

---

<Image src="assets/images/webpack-lightweight.png" size="contain" />

---

Angular's `ng eject` command can be used to "eject" webpack configuration.

... but even this hacky feature is **disabled in Angular 6**.

---

## Angular 6 and Webpack

Angular 6 will introduce *a new builder system* which is an abstraction layer on top of many build tools including webpack.

However, this system is **not ready**. And there is no announcement of when it will be ready.

---

<Image src="assets/images/webpack-ng6-soon.png" size="contain" />

---

## Undocumented breaking change

Yet, the `ng eject` is already disabled, even before the new build system is released.

And this critical breaking change is not even documented.

---

<Image src="assets/images/ng6-undocumented-breaking-change.png" size="contain" />

---

There is no migration path at this moment.

---

When a breaking change was introduced in React, React owners created a tool to **automatically migrate** the affected source code.

https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod

Note: this tool comes from React's official GitHub.

---

## Angular 6 new build system

Even when the new builder system is ready in an unknown future, I doubt why we need yet another build system to abstract most already well known build tools, including Webpack.

---

Most of the build tools' documentation are **more complete** than Angular CLI's.

Most of the build tools have **faster innovation cycles** than Angluar CLI's.

This over abstraction is **unnecessary** and even **dangerous**.

---

<Image src="assets/images/webpack-lockin.png" size="contain" />

---

A UI framework should not try to dictate the building process and tools.

The tail should not wag the dog.

---

YUI, jQuery, and even the infamous Struts didn't dictate how we build web assets.

*In a sense, Angular is worse than AngularJS when it comes to framework lock-in.*

---

Our business requires high-level of customization and scalability.

Having full control of our building process is essential to create highly customizable and scalable web apps.

---

## How can we improve?

Back to the principle:

**Maturity**: No over abstraction.

**Productivity**: Control the build tools directly.

**Community**: Rely on more complete documentation of individual build tools.

---

## Which means

Use *Webpack* directly for bundling and optimization.

Use *Lerna* to manage mono repo.

Use *npm* or *yarn* in place of Angular's *ng cli*.

... etc.

---

# Tech stack exploration

---

## The methodology

From a perspective of an outsider, use an alternative UI library or framework as a probe or **forcing function** to "question" the existing tech stack, and provide a better solution.

---

## The golden question

Without the existing tech stack, starting from a clean slate, what kind of new tech stack shall we create for better web app development as of today?

---

## What the alternative UI library will be?

---

<Image src="assets/images/react-and-friends.png" />

---

It is not about Angular vs. React.

It is about Angular vs. Something better than Angular and its ecosystem

...in terms of Productivity, Maturity, and Community.

---

# More on Community

---

## Developer preference matters

In GitHub, React has **109,545** stars and **6,244** watches while Angular has **39,862** and **3,174** watches respectively.

---

## State of JavaScript 2017

Out of 20,000 developers surveyed, 7,600 developers said they are uninterested in Angular despite of being aware of its popularity while none of the developers said they are uninterested in React.

---

<Image src="assets/images/developer-acceptance.png" size="contain" />

---

## NPM downloads

Number of npm loads in the past 6 months

---

<Image src="assets/images/npm-downloads.png" size="contain" />

---

## Market demand

A 2018 survey of more than 60,000 worldwide open positions that require a specific knowledge of a certain framework.

---

<Image src="assets/images/indeed-pie-chart.png" size="contain" />

---

## What do all these charts mean to us?

---

Larger talent pool

More active community support

---

But the thing that really matters:

More sources to copy and paste code from Stackoverflow

```notes
React Pros:
- Virtual DOM - server side rendering
  * Angular Universal is a library designed to make your app friendly to search engine and social media. This tool allows you to create projects that support server-side rendering. As for React, SSR can be set up without any additional tools since ‘renderToString’ comes from ‘react-dom’ package, which is used for client-side rendering.
  * React Native for iOS and Andriod - allowing developers to share 90% or more of the code across mobile platforms with truly native rendering performance.
  * Microsoft would later release React Native libraries for building Windows applications
  * Facebook released Snapchat-like features across Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Blocked Snapchat's growth.
- JSX compiler
- JS-first philosophy - Just Javascript
- Easy to learn
- High level of flexibility and composability
- Unopinonated
- Separation of presentation and data - Smart vs dumb component (account-summary component)
- Code assisance for Styled-Component dynamic props

Angular Cons:
- Heavy framework
  * Too many terminologies - It even speaks its own language - structural directives, pipes, declarations, modules, injectors, services, view encapsulation, decorators.
  * Large learning curve
- Template driven
  * HTML parser
  * Or use AOT compiler. But AOT has a lot of constraints of how you write your code
    * https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler#how-aot-works
    * Issue: No default export class (https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11402). Open since 9/6/2016
    * Having two different compilers is dangerous.
  * Angular 4’s release notes even went as far to tout “else” with *ngIf as a new feature.
  * It can take 10x as much code in Angular and more wiring and ceremony to describe the same output. (Productivity)
- Opinionated
  * Opinionated framework needs a buy-in phase.
  * As engineers, we should make educated choices rather than simply following opinions, even when the opinions coming from big players.
- DI is not necessarily needed
- Native ShadowDOM support is minimal (https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdom)
  * Make people question the maturity of Angular
```
